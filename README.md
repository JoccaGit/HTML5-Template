# An HTML5 Template
A responsive template with vanilla CSS.

Handy for if you wanna compare with for example Bootstrap boilerplate HTML files.<br>
Also if you wanna create a working layout for a site without help of a framework.

The goal of this project is to have an HTML5 template-site with a header, a main menu (and alternate menu), 
a footer and two mid-sections. Responsive of course, through the use of media queries. 

This template is inspired by www.lingulo.com and www.tutorialzine.com.

Specifically:
https://github.com/ChristophAnastasiades/ and
See http://www.lingulo.com/tutorials/css/how-to-build-a-html5-website-from-scratch for information on the included jQuery 
code (modernizer and respond and prefix free) and more.
