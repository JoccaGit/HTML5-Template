# An HTML5 Template
A responsive template with vanilla CSS and JS.<br>
No frameworks (except for jQuery).

Handy for comparing with for example Bootstrap CSS code and for creating a working layout for a site without the help of a framework.

### The Goal
To have an HTML5 template-site with a header, a main menu (and alternate menu), 
a footer and two mid-sections. Responsive of course, through the use of media queries. 

This template is inspired by www.lingulo.com and www.tutorialzine.com.
